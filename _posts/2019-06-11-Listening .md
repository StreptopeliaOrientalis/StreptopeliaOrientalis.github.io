##### G/Boarding School Syndrome

趋势//The number of children boarding has been **in long-term decline** in this country, but now strangely it's beginning to rise again.

许多 //I've put an awful lot of work into doing that.

名字//So prevalent have those impacts been that they actually have a name now, which is boarding school syndrome.

创伤//What that means is you have a great deal of difficulty connecting with the full range of your emotional life. It means that you have trouble forming attachments, trouble maintaining intimate relationships. You come out basically **emotionally disabled** and it takes a very long time to get yourself **back on track**.

后果//So we **end up with** an elite with people in positions of power who are emotionally damaged. That's **a very dangerous place to be**, because children who are taught to deny their own feelings also learn to deny other people's feelings.

抓回//"That's mine!" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.

"Get out, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.
